    <p>Hi, I am Gabriel Alvarado. I am 20 years of age and I would like to become a UI/UX designer. From the very early age I had this little obsession with coding and I started self-taught process which consisted of exploring online resources such as YouTube tutorials and relying on Google to unveil the mysteries of programming. This wasn't just about gaining skills, it was learning how to learn, how to solve problems, and self-development. As sounds of each line of code I wrote, I broke through to the technology world, becoming stronger and more experienced. Currently, I am about to cross the threshold to adulthood. I am brimming over with an insatiable desire that drives me to create multifaceted digital experiences which reflect both the vision of the user and the simplicity of use. My transformation from a learner fascinated by User Interface (UI/UX) design is a living proof of self-motivation and the innumerable chances that wait for people who have what it takes.

    </p>
